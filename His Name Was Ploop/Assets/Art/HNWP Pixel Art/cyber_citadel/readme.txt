//HOW TO USE THIS ASSET//
/////////////////////////

Hello! Thank you for purchasing the Cyber Citadel tileset. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- In the main folder, you will find a folder named PNG. This folder contains all the objects, backgrounds, and tiles as descriptively-named PNGs.

- In the main folder, you will also find a folder named spritesheet. This folder contains the spritesheet (PNG) and two choices of metadata format (JSON or TXT) for reading the spritesheet. (Pick the format you like!)

- The format for the TXT spritesheet is as follows: name = x y width height

- You can help make sense of the labels using the following guide, which applies to all my tilesets.

File name definitions:
	- "terrain"				Part of the tileset's terrain. The player probably stands on this.
	- "left/right/top/bottom"		The left/right/top/bottom wall or edge of the terrain.
	- "bg1", "bg2", etc.			Background. Higher number indicates further back.
	- "fg1", "fg2", etc.			Foreground. Higher number indicates further forwards.
	- "_A", "_B", "_C", etc.		A suffix with a letter indicates there are multiple variants of this object.
	- "frame0000", "frame0001", etc.	Filenames like this indicate an animation.
	- "2x2", "4x4", etc.			Indicates the size of this object, in tiles.

- Pretty much every object and tile is a size multiple of 8x8 pixels. They're made to stick to an 8x8 grid, but you don't necessarily have to stick to a grid if you don't want to.

- Be sure to check out the included example image to see how to put the tileset together.

Any questions?
Email me at contact@untiedgames.com and I'll try to answer as best I can!
